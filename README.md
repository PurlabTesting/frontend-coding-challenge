# Purlab coding task

The purpose of this task is to assess your style and approach to real-world development. This is not
a brain-teaser algorithm challenge, but representative of a task you may need to do if working at
Purlab.

This repo contains a basic create-react-app with additional tooling and config added to closely
resemble Purlab's development environments.

### Instructions
Fork this repo to your own account. When done with the task, make a pull request back into this original repo.

### Task: Date of Birth Picker
Build a form element component that allows a user to enter their birthday.

Please take into consideration all edge cases, UX / usability, potential problems etc.

The component should be easy to use, work well and look good on all devices.

The component should pass its data upwards to the parent component however you see fit (props, context, hooks, etc);

Set up a route to render and view this component. e.g. `/birthdayPicker`

Feel free to add whatever tools or libraries you need.
